# 🎙️ Emotion Recognition from Speech - CodeAlpha Internship (Task 2)

This project classifies human emotions (happy, sad, angry, etc.) based on audio speech using MFCC features and a CNN model. Developed as part of the Machine Learning Internship at CodeAlpha (August 2025).

---

## 🎧 Dataset
- Dataset used: RAVDESS (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song)
- Audio features extracted using MFCCs via Librosa

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Python
- Librosa, Soundfile
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, NumPy

---

## 🧠 Model Summary
- Features: MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)
- Labels: 8 emotion classes (e.g., happy, angry, sad)
- Architecture: 1D CNN with 2 conv layers + dense
- Accuracy: ~85% (depending on data split)

---

## 📈 Performance
- Training and validation accuracy graphs
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC-AUC curve (optional)
